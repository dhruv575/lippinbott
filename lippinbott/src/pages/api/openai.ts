Includes dictionaries, encyclopedias, handbooks, guides to the literature, bibliographies, finding books, using indexes, annual reviews, style guides, and other resources. Overview Getting Started Books Journals and Articles Research Tools Statistics, Data, & Mapping Dissertations Doctoral dissertations are book-length works of original research. (Some dissertations, typically in economics and demography, are collections of article-length research reports.) Dissertations are particularly useful for several reasons: They may cover current events, or they may address very recent scholarship practices, more quickly than journal articles or books. They may provide very detailed primary-source material (interview transcripts, text reproductions, expanded statistical treatments), methodological descriptions (questionnaires, interview protocols, event recording templates), and other useful supporting information typically omitted from journal articles or books. They include chapter-length literature reviews, as doctoral candidates are expected to situate their dissertation topic within the larger research community. Penn Sociology & Demography dissertations Penn doctoral dissertations, print and fulltext, are discoverable through Franklin Catalog, using the subject heading pattern, \"Penn dissertations--[department]\". Publicly-accessible Penn dissertations are available in Scholarly Commons. ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global (aka UMI) The comprehensive database of U.S. doctoral dissertations, recently expanded to cover foreign dissertations. For 1997-present, fulltext is often available. For older dissertations, fulltext is scarce - use ILL:Request Book when fulltext is not available. HINT! Search PQDT using \"Anywhere except full text - ALL\". PQDT is a fulltext database, and dissertations are book-length works. \"ALL\" will search titles and abstracts only.
